 Tables A.1- A.8 detail the comparative results of re-ILP, SDP, AMA2, GRASP,
 and LMLS on the 412 small and medium benchmark instances under both
normal and relaxed tests conditions. Columns 1-2 list names and best known
 values (BKV). Columns 3-10 report results (f) and time (t in seconds) for
 re-ILP, SDP, AMA2 and GRASP. Columns 11-12 display LMLS’s results un
der normal test condition. Subsequent columns report the best results (fbest),
 average results (favg), and average time (tavg) in seconds to reach the best
 results of LMLS relaxed over 10 independent runs.
 Tables A.9- A.12 compare re-ILP, GRASP and LMLS on the 140 large in
stances, with similar structures: instance names and best known values (BKV )
 in columns 1-2; results (f) and time (t) to reach the results of re-ILP and
 GRASP in columns 3-6; results of LMLS (normal test with one run) and time
 in columns 7-8, and the best results (fbest), average results (favg), average time
 (tavg) to reach the best results of LMLS relaxed (relaxed test with 10 runs) in
 the remaining columns.
 Tables A.13- A.16 show the comparative results of re-ILP, re-GRASP and
 LMLS on the 20 real-world benchmark instances. The first column lists in
stance names, while columns 2-3 show the re-ILP’s results (f) and time (t
 in seconds). Columns 4-5 show re-GRASP’s normal test results (f) and time
 (t in seconds) and columns 6-8 present re-GRASP’s relaxed test outcomes:
 the best results (fbest), the average results (favg), and the average time (tavg
 in seconds) over 10 independent runs. Columns 9-10 report the LMLS’s nor
mal test results (f) and time (t), and the last columns summarize LMLS’s
 relaxed test statistics: the best results (fbest), the average results (favg), and
 the average time (tavg). Entries “-” indicate unavailable data in the literature.
 Entries with “n/a” signify that no solution is obtained by re-ILP within the
 time limit. The best results are emphasized in bold and the optimal results
 are marked with “*”.
 Tables A.1- A.16 show that LMLS outperforms the reference algorithms in
 all instances, securing 162 new upper bounds and 410 equal results (including
 289 known optima). Furthermore, LMLS achieves 172 better results and 400
 equal results compared to GRASP (re-GRASP).
